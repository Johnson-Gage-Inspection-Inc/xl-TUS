# TUS Workbook
## Pyrometry

#### ðŸŽ¯ **Purpose**
The goal of the TUS process is to validate and certify that each unit under test meets uniform temperature distribution criteria, as required by **AMS 2750** (aerospace and thermal processing standard). JGI provides certifiable, traceable reports for customers based on detailed sensor data.

### ðŸ§ª **Core Workflow**

1. **Setup Phase** (Requires internet connection)
   - Initial user inputs (Requires internet. For offline use, do this first, then save the file)
    - Work order number (i.e. 56561-012345)
    - Work item number (defaults to 1)
    - Daqbook asset tag (i.e. J1)
    - Wire set SN
   - Offsets for reference standards and metadata for the order, customer, and UUT are then automatically populated

2. For offline use, save the file before you leave JGI (or otherwise disconnect from the internet).  This will save the offsets and metadata within your workbook, for later use.


### ðŸ“š **Documentation**

For detailed technical information and calculations, see the `docs/` folder:

- **`LiveTUS_Uncertainty_InternalRef.pdf`** - Comprehensive document detailing the uncertainty calculation methodology, statistical analysis, and validation procedures used in the TUS process. This document provides the theoretical background and mathematical basis for the temperature uniformity survey calculations and certification process.
